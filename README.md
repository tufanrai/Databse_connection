This the code where for the first time i learned to connect my server to the database. 
Here, I have created separate files for separate operations like for the product schema i have created a product schema file and created a basic product schema.
then I exported it from the file and accessed it in the request responce controller file from where all the request and response of the user are controlled. I also
created a separate function file where the server gets connected to the database and the exported the function. I called the function on the main scripting file to and 
sent the url of the database to connect the server.
